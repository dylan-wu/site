# Voronoi Diagram

Learning about voronoi diagrams using mathematica now, in Wikipedia, they are defined as:

"A partition of a plane into regions close to each of a given set of objects."

What is being done in the paper is a voronoi region is being generated by $$a\in\alpha$$, denoted by $$M(a|\alpha)$$, and is defined to be the set of all elements in $$\R^d$$ which are nearest to $$a$$.

And, like the graph above from mathematica, the point $$a$$ can be thought of as the centroid of its Voronoi region if $$a=E(X:X\in M(a|\alpha))$$, where $$X$$ is a $$P$$-distributed random variable.

So perhaps $$a$$ is similar to the orange dot above?

The next paragraph is proposition $$1.1$$ which states:

Let $$\alpha$$ be an optimal set of $$n$$-means, $$a\in\alpha$$, and $$M(a|\alpha)$$ be the Voronoi region generated by $$a\in\alpha$$. Then for every $$a\in\alpha$$, ($$i$$) $$P(M(a\alpha))>0$$, ($$ii$$) $$P(\partial M(a|\alpha))=0$$, ($$iii$$) $$a=E(X:X\in M(a|\alpha))$$, and $$(iv)$$ $$P$$-almost surely the set $$\{M(a|\alpha):a\in\alpha\}$$ forms a Voronoi partition of $$\R^d$$

This proposition states that if $$\alpha$$ is an optimal set and $$a\in\alpha$$, then $$a$$ is the conditional expectation of the random variable $$X$$ given that $$X$$ takes values in the Voronoi region of $$a$$.

Conditional expectation is the expected value of a random variable, basically the "average" value it would take on over an arbitrarily large number of occurences.

I'm not exactly sure what "optimal" set means, doing a quick google search gives me a few options like "perfect set" and "ideal (set theory)," but nothing that explicitly states optimal.
