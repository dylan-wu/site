I've just started my Complex Variables class and completed the first homework assignment.

Tools like wolfram alpha, geogebra and desmos are super useful to visualize and verify my work. For example, there are several questions that asked me to graph or sketch a graph of some set in the complex plane. Now, geogebra and desmos don't have a "complex plane" feature, but that's no problem, because of what I've learend previously that the complex plane and standard cartesian plane are practically the same!

Other situations, like, when converting from exponential to polar or rectangular form, can also be easily verified using something like wolfram alpha, or even mathematica. Sometimes it's even kind of surprising that I've gotten a question correct, I'm not sure if that's bad or good.
