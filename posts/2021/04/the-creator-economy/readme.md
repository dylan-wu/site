More and more people nowadays are getting their entertainment straight from streaming sites like Netflix, or from their favorite YouTube creators. I myself haven't watched "T.V." in what seems like years.

That made me wonder a bit on how much companies have been spending on advertising in mass media.

In 2020, Google revealed that YouTube makes nearly $15 billion-a-year in advertising revenue alone. That's a quarter of the $61 billion on total TV advertising in the U.S., but YouTube's revenue is almost certainly on the rise, while TV advertising is not.

In 2017, 17 Million Americans reported earning income by posting their creations onto nine different platforms in 2017, with instagram at the top of the pack at 5.6 million creators.

A creator doesn't even necessarily have to be someone who vlogs about their life or posts selfies. A creator is simply someone who's made their own product, whether it be a video, an online service, photos, paintings, sculptures or music, and is publishing them somewhere for the world to see.

Through some more research, I learned that this rise in independent creators and creative content, is called the "Creator Economy"

Taking advantage of this Creator Economy is easy, youtube channels are incredibly simple to start, and practically any old macbook can edit together video. Entire films can even be produced with just a single camera and a computer.

Basically, it seems like a no brainer now to at least *try* and put personalized content, not everyone will succeed to the grade that, say, PewDiePie will, but the market for creative content is unique, in that it's practically never saturated. There'll always be some niche left unoccupied that's just waiting to be filled.
