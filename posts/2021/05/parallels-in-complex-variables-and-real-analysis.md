# Parallels in Complex Variables and Real Analysis

[A First Course in Complex Analysis by Matthias beck, Gerald Marchesi, Dennis Pixton, and Lucas Sabalka](http://math.sfsu.edu/beck/papers/complexorth.pdf)

After looking through my Complex Analysis textbook a bit, I'm surprised at how many parallels there are with Real Analysis. I guess I don't know what I was expecting, but many of the definitions for fields, rings, etc are incredibly similar to Real Analysis' descriptions.

Recently I also came across a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALc8CBYOfkw) by Sabine Hossenfelder, a particle physicist on YouTube who creates videos that break down the latest scientific news and different scientific topics in easy to understand chunks. In the video, she talks about whether or not Complex numbers exist. Or more specifically, whether or not we really need complex numbers in order to do mathematics. This video was in response to a relatively recent paper published entitled "[Quantum Physics Needs Complex Numbers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10873.pdf)"

There's a specific line in the vdieo that talks about how any and all solutions to polynomial equations can be expressed in the form of $$a + i\cdot b$$. I've encountered this specific notation before, however, I did not know that any and all polynomial expressions could be expressed in such a form.

Extending from this, the book also introduced me to the notation for $$e^i(\psi)$$. This then led to me learnign what a root of unity was.

The definition reads as follows:

```
A root of unity is a number of the form $$e^{2\pi i \frac{m}{n}}$$ for some integers $$m$$ and $$n>0$$. Equivalently, a root of unity is a complex number such that this complex number to the nth power is 1 for some positive integer n.
```

One of the crucial understandings as well is that the complex numbers are basically the same as the real numbers in terms of the properties, this means that definitions of groups, rings, fields, and definitions of addition and multiplication can be much the same.
