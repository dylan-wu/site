title: Thoughts On What I've Learned About Quantization So Far

So I've been learning about Quantization for the past couple weeks, using things like Wolfram Mathematica to understand some of the vocabulary better, as well as giving me visual representations of something like, say, a Voronoi diagram.

The biggest question that I have so far after reading through some of the papers, is, how do propositions come up in the first place?

What I mean is that many of these propositions are awfully specific, for example propositions 4.5 and 4.6 all have specific numbers in place for coordinates and then the error values. I understand that once we have a proposition we need to prove it, but what comes first? The proof or the proposition? If it's the proposition, then where do we get these specific numbers from? If its the proof, then how do we know what we're proving when we're actually proving it?

Neither of these options seems to make any sense to me, which in my mind means that there's some third option, that somehow we get the proposition without needing a proof.

There are other ideas and topics that I have yet to fully grasp as well, however, for the most part I have an understanding of what is being done. The proofs seem easy enough to understand, we are mainly dealing with probability distributions.
