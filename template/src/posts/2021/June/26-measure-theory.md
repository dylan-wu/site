From the textbook Real Analysis Measure Theory Integration and Hilbert Spaces

Why is this lemma 1.1 important? In fact, why do we care about rectangles in $R^d$ at all?

In this case, $|R|$ means the volume of the rectangle $R$ (what's up with mathematicians and their love of $|$? It's used everywhere, in a number of different applications!)

This lemma itself also seems relatively self evident, we're basically saying that if we have one rectangle that can be made up of a bunch of other rectangles, the volume of the larger rectangle is the same as the sum of the volume of all the smaller ones.

This theorem seems rather interesting as well (not in the least because there's a picture attached)

This sort of reminds me of rasterization, where a vector images is split into pixels/squares.
