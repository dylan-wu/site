The concept of terraforming has been around for centuries, to terraform is to turn a planetoid, like the moon or mars, into a hospitable environment for Humans. 
Humans are explorers. So long as there is more space to explore, you can be sure that we’ll try to expand there. So it’s no mystery that we’re already making plans to live on Mars. Mars is very similar to Earth. It sits just on the edge of the “Habitable zone” or “goldilocks zone” where liquid water can still form, it’s roughly Earthlike in size, and most interestingly, there’s evidence that it harbored liquid water sometime in the last few billion years.
The thing is, right now, Mars isn’t exactly your perfect summer vacation home, with below-freezing temperatures, severe radiation, an atmosphere less than 1% of Earth’s, and massive, deadly dust storms that can block out the sun for days at a time, you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone who wants to live there. And so, before we can call Mars our second home, we first need to terraform it.
There are two priorities when it comes to terraforming Mars: Heating the planet up Creating a breathable, or at the very least, livable, atmosphere. With these two done, you’re able to have liquid water on the planet. With liquid water, Animals and plants can survive and even thrive. Sounds easy enough buuuuut doing so takes an astronomical amount of energy.
These two priorities actually go hand in hand, by creating an atmosphere, we can heat the planet’s surface up. There are a couple ways to do this, one, is by melting all of the ice that’s located in the two polar ice caps. One way to do this is, well, by nuking the polar ice caps, though doing so would only about double Mars’ atmosphere, [insert 1% to 2% animation] Unfortunately, that’s nowhere near good enough. In fact, in order to get Mar’s atmosphere similar to Earth’s we would need to vaporize about a million, billion tons of carbon rich mars soil. That would take 10,000 nuclear, gigawatt power plants running nonstop for 40,000 years. Perhaps the “Best” way to give mars an atmosphere, is to actually throw a few thousand oxygen and nitrogen rich comets at it. This would comparatively take a short amount of time, but would logistically be incredibly challenging, as redirecting a few thousand comets towards a planet takes, as you can imagine, a lot of time and planning.

Terraforming Mars is a huge commitment, and will probably require the combined might of multiple nations, and at minimum take centuries or even millennia, it’ll take so long that human beings born on Mars will evolve to the point of being easily recognizable from “earthlings,” you’d be able to point to someone and say “Oh that’s a martian” or “that’s an earther.” That being said, Mars will be livable inside colonies, and artificial habitats, most likely within a couple decades after the first human expedition. And who knows, maybe you’ll be one of the first people to colonize Mars. Thanks for watching.
