When traveling from planet to planet, it's not as simple as just going in a straight line, planets are moving at incredible speeds, and the next nearest planet from Earth, Mars, is a whopping 209.43 million miles.

To put this in perspective, the Perseverance rover was crossing 3 soccer fields in literally the time it takes to blink, and it still took 7 months to make it to Mars.

The Sun also plays an important role in travel, since everything in the solar system is affected by the Sun's gravity, we'll have to factor that into our travel.

If we want to use the least amount of fuel possible to travel from one planet to another, we'll follow a trajectory called the Hohmann Transfer Orbit.

A Hohmann Transfer Orbit consist of two separate burns. Once you've launched your rocket into Earth's orbit, you need to then use a burn in order to get out of Earth's gravitational pull, this will send you flying riding on the Sun's gravity, into the trajectory of Mars about 7 - 9 months later, at this point we produce one more burn in order to slow down and get caught by Mars' gravity.

If you go on Wikipedia and search for Hohmann Transfer Orbit, it'll actually give you a way to fairly easily calculate for yourself a Hohmann Transfer Orbit. There are plenty of resources online as well that provide classroom guides on how to calculate the trajectory. Unfortunately, in real life, it's nowhere near as simple, and in fact is quite difficult to do via hand calculation. This is because in real life, orbits are not perfectly circular, and are slightly squished, which means that in some portions of the orbits, the objects are moving faster than in others (Kepler's second law). Mars and Earth aren't even on the same plane of orbit, Mars is tilted a couple of degrees relative to Earth.

As such, this complicates the calculation significantly.
