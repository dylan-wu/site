If you don't know where you are going, you'll end up someplace else.‚Äù -- Yogi Berra (no, not Yogi Bear)

That's one of my favorite quotes, and as this is the first blog post on this website, I thought that I might follow Yogi Berra's advice, and state publicly what my goals are for this blog.

I want to become someone like [Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/user/Sepharoth64) and [Thomas Frank](https://www.youtube.com/user/electrickeye91), someone who talks about, gives tips about productivity, life style, and be entertaining in the process. I want to do this by following some of the same methods that most teen, or young creators are taking now, namely, building/learning in public. What that means is that I'll be sort of broadcasting my learning, experiences, pitfalls and mistakes. I'll be consistently posting on twitter any little daily things that I discover, while this blog will be used for larger topics, collections or groups of thoughts that can all come together to form some coherent subject.
