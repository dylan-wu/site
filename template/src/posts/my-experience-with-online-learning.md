When quarantine hit, a lot of my friends were at odds with the online format of their classes. Online classes were clunky, and many students were, and still are ill equipped to handle the responsibilities that come with being able to learn online.

In a way though, I think online classes might have been a blessing in disguise, for some, at least.

You see, when quarantine started, I was almost unaffected because I'd already been doing homeschooling for a good few years by that point. Obviously I went out a little less on weekends, but overall, nothing in my life really changed.

I started homeschooling back at the start of 7th grade (I'm in 10th grade now). And while it was a little rocky in the beginning, trying to nail down the best methods to use for online learning, overall, I'd say that I've had a pretty successful experience. I got the chance to enroll at my local community college, and so far I've earned over 40 college credits, and am about to take some graduate level math courses this 2021 summer. My social life certainly hasn't died down, in fact, I have more friends now than I ever did in Elementary school of Middle school, I feel attending a college where everyone was older really helped to jump start my maturity and extroverted-ness.

I think that for a lot of students today, the problems that they're having with online classes are totally founded. I don't think it's the student's fault, or the teacher's fault that online classes are as miserable and ineffective as they are.

Instead, I think the reason online classes don't work for my friends, and why online learning certainly works for me, is the way that we've set up these online classes. In my own learning, very little of my "studying" time is perfectly constructed in time blocks, sure, I have set times where I do study, but what I do in that period, which assignments I work on, which essays I write, are totally up to me.

I think that student learning time is too structured to work well in an online format, heck, the whole point of learning online is that you get the chance to learn when you think works best for you, the best part is the freedom that you get.

I also believe that students need specific new learning techniques and skills in order to use online resources to their fullest. "New" note taking methods, progress recording methods, time tracking tools, all of these things are available to students. Tools like Notion, Roam Research, Coda, even something like Khan Academy can go a long way to boosting someone's learning. But as far as I can tell, almost none of my friends have ever heard of those applications.

That's why I'm creating a course and SaaS project to help students get the online learning skills, resources, and support they need to make the most of their time.

Just imagine if every high schooler learned Calculus, or American History, or English Composition, or a Foreign language online, and for free.
