# Introduction

English language has 44 distinct sounds, or phonemes. But there are many languages that don't require that many sounds. For example, Mandarin Chinese only has 20 - 30 (depending on what you classify as a phoneme).

# Small languages

So then, what's the least number of sounds required to create a usable human language? The Pirahã language spoken by the Pirahã people of Amazonas, Brazil, have only 14 phonemes, the Rotokas language spoken by only a few thousand people in Papua New Guinea has even fewer sounds, at 11. So we know that human languages can be created with as little as 11 phonemes, but can we go even lower?

## Limits of Small Languages

The trouble with languages with a small number of phonemes, is that you'll inevitably have words that sound a LOT like each other, this already happens in larger languages, like English (think "Here" and "Hear"), and so this few number of sounds could prove to be a limiting factor in terms of, say, vocabulary size and word retention.

# Computer Language

Computers "think" in terms of ones and zeros, any input that we give to the computer must first be translated into binary before it can be processed, and so in a way, we can think of binary as computer language.

The issues of small languages mentioned above become painfully apparent however when using Binary, for example, the word "Apple" is "01000001 01110000 01110000 01101100 01100101" in binary, good luck remembering that!

Of course, it might be possible in the near future to speak in "binary," like the Bynars from Star Trek

# Big languages

On the other end of the spectrum, what's the most phonemes that a language can boast?

The Taa language, spoken by a couple thousand people, mainly in Botswana, has perhaps the largest number of phonemes in the world, at a little over 200. Different problems arise with big languages than with small ones, namely that it seems to be prohibitively difficult to pick up the language if you're not a native speaker, due to the sheer number of different sounds you'd have to remember and pick out.

# Conclusion

Human languages are incredibly diverse, from something like Rotokas which has a mere 11 different sounds, to Taa with it's 200+, or even English, which borrows words from seemingly every language in the world. But as different as human languages are, it seems that nearly every single human being can learn any language just from listening to it (think how babies learn to speak). Which is, if you really think about it, such an astonishing idea, that every human being can learn to communicate, regardless of how difficult or easy, or how many sounds or how little sounds a language has.
