Fundamental problem that is being proposed is: How can we combine that degree of individual initiative which is necessary for progress with the degree of social cohesion that is necessary for survival?

Or, more simply, how is possible to mix innovation and individuality with social order and community to have an effective civil society, while also making maximum progress.

The ant and the bee are the greatest examples of social cohesion, they are never tempted to deviate from the social-norm. This can be admired, as many of the greatest human tragedies have occured as a result of anti-social actions. However, ants and bees do not produce great works of art, they do not think as Human beings do, they do not make scientific discoveries, nor do they produce any sort of coherent ideas or realizations.

Ants and bees are a stagnant object, each individual ant or bee is perfectly shaped and molded for the role they are meant to engage in, and as such there is no room for growth or ingenuity.

There are very few, if any, animals who engage in life alone. Life is by nature social, and it requires community and cooperation. Human beings are no exception. Early man was a risky evolutionary invention, creating a being with more capacity for independence also opened the door to individual weakness.

Those human beings who could cooperated well with others rose to the top of the food chain, while those who could not died off. This also implies that those who were most intelligent survived, as surely any intelligent creature could realize their own need for others.

The most atomic unit of community was, and still is, the family. Necessitated by the great length of Human infancy, the mother of young infants is seriously handicapped in the work of food gathering. Much like birds, this would make the Father of the group essential, this is certainly why Males were relegated to the task of hunting, while females stayed home.
