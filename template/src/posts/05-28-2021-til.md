Do those who create great works of art, Tolstoy with War and Peace and Anna Karenina. Shakespeare and his miriad of plays, Dante's Divine Comedy, Da Vinci's Mona Lisa, Michelangelo's David and The Pieta, imagine themselves as creating something so profound that will last for centuries? Did they ever have that moment of realization where they stepped back to look at their finished work and realized "Oh wow, I've just made something truly beautiful."?

Somehow I imagine not. I watched a [video on War and Peace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dn7TEjnbPY&list=PLJicmE8fK0EiUroVhuEyeOYkAGAAB58Xx) from a TED-Ed, and I liked the way they described what War and Peace was.

>It is, in other words, the sum total of Tolstoy's imaginative powers, and nothing less.

You could say that Tolstoy gave all of himself to his works. There aren't many who can do that, because it requires something more than just love and devotion for what you do. To give all of yourself to something, you have to love that something more than you love yourself. By definition, then, what you strive for must be something that comes from deep within yourself. When Dante Alighieri wrote the Divine Comedy, it was so that he could himself experience and explore his own weaknesses, desires and loves. Sharing them to the public was simply a byproduct of his struggles. Why else would he introduce characters that, many times, meant so much only to him?

There are plenty of things, and plenty of people who love that much, but you must also be blessed with a sort of innate talent for the thing you love. You must be a genius. But what does that really mean? Genius is sort of a cliche word, you can explain away any incredible thing by saying "oh they're a genius." But what does it take to be a genius? Certainly people aren't born incredible, even Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs at some point, what matters is how quickly they gained this knowledge, and the degree to which they mastered it. So how did Shakespeare get from learning his ABCs as any other child, to being the most celebrated playwright in all of western civilization? The only thing that changed from these two points, is Shakespeare himself, and he changed *because* he was writing. Imagine how many *failed* plays Shakespeare had? ANd so it was the process itself that made Shakespeare the genius he was. He clearly was born with innate talent, or else we might have hundreds of Shakespeares, instead of just the one.

If you have read or seen any of the works I mentioned in the first paragraph, you might notice a trend. ALl of them encapsulate something about humans. Many of them, the trappings that we love to attribute to Human character. Love and betrayal, sorrow and greed, guilt and pride.

These works are also just plainly beautiful. This becomes increasingly obvious when looking at works from Michelangelo. If you've ever seen pictures of The Pieta, you should know what I mean.

It was carved from a single slab of marble, each and every fold of Mary's clothing was carved by Michelangelo, who was only 24 at the time of completing the work. But no matter if it was made by a team of 100 masters, I believe the Pieta would still be hailed as one of the greatest works of art. Very few things are so very obviously beautiful.

Humans are simple, narcissistic creatures. We enjoy beautiful things that speak of our own flaws and strengths. When someone creates works that truly encapsulate these, they are undoubtedly, and rightfully, hailed as legendary.
