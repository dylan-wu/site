This summer, I'll be taking Elementary Cryptology MATH 3347 from UTRGV

Abbreviated quotes:

"[Cryptology is] the subject of how to make ciphers (cryptography) and break them (cryptanalysis). The math used is heavy on modular arithmetic. It also makes some use of elementary counting and probability, plus a tiny bit of linear algebra and matrices."
