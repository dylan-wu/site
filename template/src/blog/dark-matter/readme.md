Currently in the world of Physics, we have two theories that describe the behavior of matter, the standard model, which describes elementary particles like quarks, electrons, muons, and so on, as well as all the fundamental forces, except for Gravity. The other theory is Einstein’s theory of relativity, which describes the force of gravity produced by all types of matter and energy

Unfortunately, when you attempt to combine relativity and the standard model, weird things happen that don’t go in line with our observations.

For example, our observations show that galaxies rotate faster than is allowed by our theories, galaxies and clusters move too fast, gravitational lenses bend light too strongly, and the cosmic microwave background radiation shouldn’t look the way it does.

You might have heard of the term dark matter used to describe these discrepancies before.

Dark Matter is simply an addition to Einstein’s Theory of relativity that allows the union of it and the standard model to make sense.

That’s literally it, you can kind of think about it as a tool for convenience, it might not be entirely correct, but it works, and that’s all we care about.

The really interesting thing is just how well dark matter works. Relativity actually has 10 different equations that you have to make work when combining with the standard model. Now, you might think that in order to do this, you’d need 10 different values of “dark matter,” but that’s not the case.

What we do know about “dark matter,” though is that it’s, well, not actually “dark,” it’s more transparent, in that it doesn’t interact with any sort of light wavelengths
