There are only 24 people ever to venture far enough to see Earth amidst the blackness of space. The next destination for space exploration is our biggest leap yet. The Red Planet. Mars.

There are a couple of things we'll have to get right to get to Mars, the rocket and the launch timing. Our rocket needs to be traveling at at least 40,270 km/h to escape Earth's gravity, this is called the escape velocity of Earth. The ultimate speedo f our rocket can be calculated using Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, or more simply, THE Rocket Equation, which goes to show how important it is.

Mars and Earth orbit the Sun at different speeds and distances, sometimes Earth and Mars are far away from one another, and other times they're relatively close. We'll want to launch the rocket with the least amount of fuel possible, and so we'll use something called the "Hohmann transfer orbit."

Named after German Scientist Walter Hohmann, the Hohmann transfer orbit is the most fuel-efficient way to travel between two circular orbits. We launch our rocket with just enough fuel to get it out of Earth's orbit. Then, after riding on our rocket's momentum and the Sun's gravity for seven months, we do one final burn to put us into Mars' orbit.

During that seven-month journey, our astronauts will have to contend with deadly radiation, isolation, and any number of other issues they might encounter.

Once we've gotten to Mars, the real challenge starts: Setting up a permanent base.

For our scientists to safely live on Mars, we'll need to provide them with the three basic human needs, food, water, and shelter.

If our expedition lands somewhere near the Martian poles, then we'll have all the water we need, though it will be a bit chilly, -140 degrees celsius chilly to be precise.

To heat our habitats we'll have to generate a massive amount of power, our current viable options are solar power and nuclear power. We

We'll supply our habitats with a breath of fresh air by taking in CO2 from Mars' thin atmosphere, and use chemistry to turn that CO2 into O2.

Finally, we can grow basic vegetables in our green house, and utilize something like aquaponics to provide our scientists with a more varied diet which is key to improving the mental state of the overworked, tired crew. Hope you like fish.

At this point, we can say that our Mars base has been established, and humanity has just become a multi-planetary civilization.

ðŸŽ‰Hooray!ðŸŽ‰

Routine missions can now be deployed, and more people, supplies, and equipment can be shuttled in.

Now though, the real task of terraforming red Mars, into a blue one, begins.

Terraforming Mars is a monumental task, one that probably wont be completed for centuries, maybe even millenia. But who knows, maybe one of your descendents will be the first to finally come out of their Mars habitat, and breathe in the fresh Air.
