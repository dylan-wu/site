SpaceX's starship is what will take humanity to Mars using a number of new innovations. Starship is a massive vehicle, standing at 130 meters tall, it is the largest rocket ever built.

Starship aims to massively reduce the cost of interplanetary travel, and make trips to Mars, the Moon, and other planets commercially viable.

Starship consists of two stages, the booster stage known as "Super Heavy" which is largely just a big rocket with no cargo carrying capacity; and the cargo stage, also confusingly known as "Starship." The booster stage is meant mainly for getting Starship into orbit. Because the strength of gravity decreases exponentially from your distance to the origin, the most difficult portion of getting into space is getting from Earth's surface into orbit.

The fuel that is used on Starship is a combination of liquid methane and oxgen, known as methalox. methane is the primary combustant, while the liquid oxygen is simply used to, well, oxidize and burn.
