Essentially, the student loan crisis is completely false. While it is true that there is around 1.71 trillion dollars in total student loan debt, that's drawn out among literally hundreds of million of people, and taken month by month, that's on average a $300 monthly payment. It's not someone else's responsibility to pay for your $300 debt, because nothing is free, it comes from taxpayers, money and debt don't just simply vanish and appear out of thin air, there's a process to things that cannot be avoided.

So:

1. It's not an issue, the average monthly payment is $300, if you can't make $300 after graduating, that's your own fault.
2. It's fundamentally untrue that debt can just vanish, it still must be paid by taxpayers
3. It's unfair and unjust to have taxpayers pay for someone elses debt.
