I have been going through the MITx Micromasters in Statistics and Data Science courses and as of July 2021, I have completed:

- [6.431x Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/8f52dce30e364ab2bdacbc05b9d83bf3)
- [18.6501x Fundamentals of Statistics](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/638eb74d2fbf49eba2fbcf72c729002b)
- [6.86x Machine Learning with Python: from Linear Models to Deep Learning](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/8809766248b14bdf87e0f20c39a72111)
- Data Analysis in Social Science (this course doesn't have a certificate attached to it)

Courses I have yet to complete:

- Data Analysis in Social Science—Assessing Your Knowledge starts Aug 18th
- Data Analysis: Statistical Modeling and Computation in Applications
- Capstone Exam in Statistics and Data Science starts Oct 7th

## 6.431x Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data

This course was my first introduction to probability, learning about random variables, bayesian inferences, PMFs and PDFs have all helped me in future courses, and in my research projects.

For example, one of my current research projects is to find the optimal quantization of a uniform distribution on a semi-circle, which is just a fancy way of saying that I want to find the best way to put $n$ numbers of dots along a semi-circle, so that those dots "cover" the most area.

A big aspect of the calculations and proofs in the research is using continuous random variables to calculate the best position.

## 18.6501x Fundamentals of Statistics

Like the previous course, this was my first introduction to different statistical methods and models, and has helped tremendously in understanding, my research projects.

## 6.86x Machine Learning with Python: from Linear Models to Deep Learning

This course taught me how to use python to construct models for different statistical outcomes, applying the techniques and things I learned in the previous two courses.

I've always been really interested in AI, and while I know that the things in this course aren't really "AI," it's still awesome to know how to, say, create a neural network!

## Data Analysis in Social Science—Assessing Your Knowledge

I've already completed the course required to pass this exam, so I'm just waiting for it to open up to enrollment in Summer 2021.

I'll have to go back and look at the course to brush up on anything I might've forgotten, and find the associated MIT OCW course and take their final.

## Data Analysis: Statistical Modeling and Computation in Applications

This course opens on August 30th, 2021, and I'm already enrolled.

## Capstone Exam in Statistics and Data Science

The Capstone exam is open currently, but because I am missing one class (either of the two aforementioned courses), I'm unable to enroll in the Capstone.

My best option to study this course before it opens is to somehow find some online guide, or maybe someone has catalogued some similar questions. I'll have to go look.
