After the armistice of World War I, Germany had to pay crippling reparations. Hitler pinned the blame on Jews, after World War I, Jewish success led to accusations of subversion and war profiteering.

Hitler found success with them, his manipulative public speaking made him an incredible leadership, the Nazis denounced communism and capitalism as international Jewish conspiracies. At first, the Nazi party was not popular.

In 1929, the great depression began, American banks withdrew their loans from Germany, Hitler took advantage of their anger, and promised to restore their proud German nation.

This increased their parliamentary votes from 3%, to over 18%, in just 2 years. In 1932, Hitler ran for president, and lost to Hindenburg. The following years advisors told Hindenburg to appoint Hitler to chancellor.

His supporters formed paramilitary groups and raised fears of a communist take over.

In 1933, a young worker was convicted of setting fire to the parliamentary building. Hitler used this chance to convince parliament to grant him emergency powers. The freedom of the press was abolished, other parties were disbanded, and anti-jewish laws were passed. Many of Hitler's early radical supporters were arrested and executed. And when Hindenburg died in August 1934, it was clear there would be no new election.

Hitler's powerful rhetoric put him easily in the public's favor, and businesses wanting to cur favor with the people, quickly endorsed Hitler.
