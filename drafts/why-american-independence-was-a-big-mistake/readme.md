Currently reading this paper, and formulating some thoughts. It's well written, and touches on plenty of ifs and thens.

Obviously, the biggest point of contention is that this is an article that touches on the "what ifs" of history. Reminds me of ender's game where Rackham says to Graff that what he did worked, it may not have been pretty, or even good, but it worked and you have no idea what would have happened had Rackham not done what he did.

The biggest problem that I can see is that he keeps talking and saying things as if the British Empire is far superior to the United States. Some key points he makes are the earlier emancipation of slaves
