Human beings are richer today than they ever were. Access to the internet has unlocked the potential for any human being to learn anything they want. The internet has become a platform for millions of people to turn their everyday, "normal" actions into multi-million dollar businesses, without many of the usual drawbacks that come with fame.

Today, 75% of children dream of being YouTubers, and the thing is, many of them *can*. 

From here on out is just my BLEH-ed out thoughts.

The creator economy takes advantage of human being's inherently social nature, now a single person can feel more connected and integrated with more human beings than ever before. Heck, this new abundance of online social interaction has created mental problems, like parasocial relationships, where people will view online personalities as their friends, even though they have very little personal interaction.

The key to all of this lies in the ease of access, and abundance of the internet. Practically anyone anywhere can go online and watch some youtube, or twitch, in fact we make it easier for them to get hooked on these forms of content. AI algorithms recommend us the things it thinks we wwant to watch, ad while it's not perfect, it's getting there. Imagine an AI that would be able to create the perfect piece of content, craft the perfect story, to keep you hooked, keep you binging. We're getting closer than ever before to that possibility.

And while it sounds kind of bad, it's really not, the creator economy has brought an unbelievable amount of prosperity and happiness to today's people. Think of how many lives might have been saved from suicide, depression, and other mental illnesses. Imagine how many people, who might have been so called "dead ends" 20, or even 10 years ago, have been able to transform their lives into massively productive entertainment companies.

Do you know how many people fit this description?: College dropout, working fast food, goes home to game, starts randomly streaming, gains followers...

Or even, goes to highschool, streams video games, gains followers...

The thing about the creator economy is that it's incredibly unrestrictive, practically anyone can go online and create something to fulfill a certain niche, their personality could be upbeat, extroverted, or maybe they could be introverted, and let their work speak for itself, it doesn't matter. Nearly anyone can go online and create anything and make an audience out of it.

And if you think there's a saturation limit, well, you might be right. At some point, if everyone in every household is streaming 24/7, it obviously doesn't work, but that won't happen, and right now, the number of people creating content is only rising.

That doesn't mean it's easy to make it, it's never easy to be successful, and especially with this creator economy stuff it takes work, persistence, and a little bit of luck.
