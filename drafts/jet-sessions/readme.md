## JET Sessions?

### What are JET Sessions

JET session stands for Join, Explore, Team | Tell | Teach

A JET Session is used to help a group of students learn some subject. The students are organized into groups with different interests and ability levels. Those at a higher ability level might help "teach" students. For example, say we're learning Algebra I and practicing solving systems of equations, then the students would be split into those who have high knowledge, medium and low knowledge.

It's even possible to have someone who only knows arithmetic practice within the same group as the system of equations. They just focus on doing the arithmetic and gradually see the patterns and learn how to do the system of equations.

Within the JET sessions, the teacher's main job is to coordinate between students, they get the students started, and guide everyone through the things initially. Soon though, students will get the hang of doing problems themselves, and gradually move towards mastery.

At this point, the teacher's role is to determine when to move on to the next topic.

For example, take what I do with Phi, for the most part she goes through the problems herself, I'm there to monitor her progress and help her with any mistakes that she has trouble correcting or recognizing. I let Khan Academy and the problems teach her, rather than me.

### JET sessions vs tutoring

Tutoring relies on the tutor teaching the students how to do something, for example, a student will bring a problem to a tutor, a tutor will show them how to go through it and then help the student with any other mistakes that they make. A tutor is basically a teacher with only one student.

The teacher figure for the students in JET sessions is the problems or exercises that they're going through. This is why it's so important to have a system that has videos, or step by step solutions, so that students can see that and work through it. Remember the cognitive load theory that said that it's more useful for students to see someone else do something then immediately apply it instead of trying to figure it out themselves, because by the time they figure it out, their working memory will have lost how they got there in the first place.

So JET sessions are attempting to remedy the issue that people often find with classrooms, that the teacher is swamped with students and can't possibly address all their questions. JET sessions solve this by having each student answer the questions on their own, and anything the students don't know can be directed to the teacher or problem.

### How do we ensure that students are all learning?

The way we split classes may seem weird, because we're putting students who don't have the necessary prerequisite knowledge to completely solve problems in with students who do have that knowledge. In fact, it might even be like we have students of different ages, because different grade levels learn different things.

Humans learn from example, we need a lot of examples in order to successfully extrapolate and see how to do something. So someone who's learning arithmetic, while they won't know what variables are, or how to solve algebraic equations, at least they'll understand how to add, subtract, multiply and divide. Remember that TED talk on treating math like a language? 4 billion - 1 billion is 3 billion because 4 pencils minus 1 pencil is 3 pencils. Then you're not thinking of pencils or billions as numbers, but as something to stick to the end. That's the same with variables, and students will learn that pattern of thinking.

### How do we know that the students who do know things are learning?

Something that I've noticed with teaching Phi is that kids needs a massive amount of repetition to truly understand something. Even when you think they've already understood something, it turns out they've extrapolated some false pattern from the problems they've done. And so when a problem comes that doesn't fit any of the previous patterns, their knowledge falls apart. I've experienced this with my own classes, the pattern and knowledge you've acquired only fits for a very specific set of questions, and straying out of the pattern makes the whole thing break.

In order to construct a generalized know-how, you need to do many many many problems, until you learn the generalized trick.

Take for example this:

$4-2x=0$

How do you solve for $x$ in this equation?

You might add $2x$ to both sides, and then divide by two. Students might look at this and go "Oh ok, I understand." But what they really think is that they should be adding $2x$ and then dividing by two in every problem. So when they get a problem like this:

$5-3x=0$

Then they run into problems. The number of permutations of problems is astronomical. Here, they might figure out "Oh so I add by whatever the number in front of $x$ is and then divide by the same number." But then what happens when they get a question like this?

$3x+5=0$

Then they find that the solution is not to add by $3x$. The issue is that they lack the big picture. Their goal in these equations is to isolate $x$ alone on one side, and get a number on the other side. There are countless different ways to get to that point, and so they need to learn that through repetition.

### JET Session Resources

Things like Khan Academy, Paul's Math Notes, are good resources to use because they have plenty of problems and step by step solutions. To start, probably using Khan Academy is the best bet, since it's the one people know most about, and probably has the most complete curriculum out there.

## Possible Goals

### Write a research paper on the effectiveness of JET sessions

Utilizing the FMIM PIs, or even the FMIM project itself, want to conduct a study to see the effectiveness of JET sessions.

The goal is to find out if JET sessions work to teach skills, and if they're more effective than standard classroom sessions. We could utilize a school setting, where the teacher acts as a facilitator to the JET Session, and a control group where students have standard classroom sessions. Gauge student interest rate, retention rate, etc.

Write three papers on the JET sessions:

- What are JET Sessions
- Efficacy of JET Sessions
- Survey of existing similar methods
    - Mob programming
    - Reverse classroom

### Start advertising our own JET sessions

Priority is to get people so that we can hold JET sessions ASAP, see ![](first-session.md) for more details on how to advertise, and questions.

### Build a community of learners

The most important thing is to build a community of learners that learn together, and help each other. Services like Discord help with that. One of the key requirements for a community is that there is enough incentive, the JET sessions are the primary mover for the incentives. For example, the possible incentives might be/are:

1. Improving their grades.
2. Reducing their work.
3. Test prep for AP and SAT exams.
4. Participating in extra curricular activities

With the ultimate goal of boosting their college applications a good example of this is Fiveable, but fiveable lacks the JET session aspect, and Fiveable is also different to ours in other ways.

So in the community, we can organize resources, JET sessions, and talk with students.
