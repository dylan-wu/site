The famous "March of Progress" showing humanities evolution from hunched over, tree hugging apes, to our present upright, bipedal state.

As bipedalism gets more refined, the brains get bigger. But that's not actually consistent with fossil evidence. Instead, bipedalism dates back to the origins of the lineage, and only about 2 million years ago do we really see brain size increasing.

The biggest concern with getting a bigger brain is the energy consumption that it requires. For humans today, the brain uses about 20% of available energy, that's an astronomically expensive organ.

Energy is a zero-sum game, the body dedicates its limited supply of energy to the most costly and important organs. One of the hypotheses about the brain comes from the "expensive tissue hypothesis." Basically, energy is allocated to the brain, but where does that energy come from? The idea is the digestive system. As the intestines reduce in volume, you're able to allocate more energy to a larger brain. The problem with that is you're not able to digest tough fibrous foods, like plants, as well anymore.

Then comes in the diversification of the human diet, starting to cook and eat more meat, marrow, scavenging and hunting. All of these things fueled brain growth.

Bipedalism wasn't some human evolutionary invention. It may very well have evolved a few times independently. But most early bipedal creatures spent their time in trees, only very rarely going to the ground. The reason being: bipedalism is really really risky.

Even the fastest human you can think of, probably the fastest human who ever lived, is pathetically slow compared to your typical four legged animal. Usain Bolt tops out at about 28 miles per hour. That's half the speed of a galloping zebra or antelope or leopard or lion.

Human beings didn't evolve from hominins that walked on all fours like a Gorilla. We evolved from ones that were already upright.
