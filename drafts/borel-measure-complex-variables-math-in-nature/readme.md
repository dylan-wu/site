The wikipedia definition of a Borel measure is "a measure [on a topological space] that is defined on all open sets"

The formal definition is stated to be:

Let $$X$$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space, and let $$\mathcal{B}(X)$$ be the smallest $$\sigma\text{-algebra}$$ that contains the open sets of $$X$$; this is known as the $$\sigma\text{-algebra}$$ of Borel sets. A Borel measure is any measure $$\mu$$ defined on the $$\sigma\text{-algebra}$$ of Borel sets.

There are a couple notions here that I'm completely unfamiliar with.

First, locally compact.

A locally compact space is a space where each small portion of that space looks like a small portion of a compact space, where a compact space is a more generalized notion of a subset of Euclidean space being closed and bounded.

For example, $$[0,1]$$ is compact, but neither $$(-\infin,-2]$$ or $$(2,4)$$ are compact.

Next, a Hausdorff space.

A Hausdorff space is a topological space where for any two distinct points, there exists neighbourhoods of each which are disjoint from one another.

Next, $$\sigma\text{-algebra}$$.

Sigma algebra on a set $$X$$ is a collection $$\sum$$ of subsets of $$X$$ that includes $$X$$ itself, is closed under complement, and is closed under countable unions.

Or, more simply, if we have a set $$X$$. Then a $$\sigma\text{-algebra}\space F$$ is a nonempty collection of subsets of $$X$$ such that the following hold:

1. $$X$$ is in $$F$$.
2. If $$A$$ is in $$F$$, then so is the complement of $$A$$.
3. If $$A_n$$ is a sequence of elements of $$F$$, then the union of the $$A_n$$s is in $$F$$

Next, Borel sets.

A Borel set is any set in a topological space that can be formed from open sets (or, equivalently, from closed sets) through the operations of countage union, countable intersection, and relative complement.

# Complex Variables

Somehting that I find interesting about all of these higher level math topics is how important the "previous" math topics were, namely Calculus.

Like, you learn arithmetic, and arithmetic is used for the rest of mathematics because it's literally what makes up "math," arithmetic are the most basic operations, so something similar is in Calculus, where something like the derivative or integral are used throughout any and all topics of math after Calculus, so in a way, Calculus is just a slightly more difficult Arithmetic.

Chapter two is entitled "Differentiation."

This first example where you have to prove that the limit of $$z^2$$ as z approaches i

# A Modified Right Helicoid Can Simulate the Inner Structure of the Cochlea in the Hearing Organ of Mammals

Source: https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=109151

In this paper, they discuss how a modified right helicoid can simulate the inner structure of the cochlea in the hearing organ of mammals.

Or, more simply, they are rebuilding the inner ear using a mathematically generated structure. When put this way, it doesn't seem all that astonishing, as, for example, we can see the fibonacci numbers in name all the time, and so math appearing in nature is sort of an opposite observation, nature *is* math.

This introductory paragraph mostly talks about the shape, function and features of the inner ear.
